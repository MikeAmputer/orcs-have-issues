You can use this area to write anything about your character. Heart emojis on this issue will increase your character's stats.

To control your character, add a comment with commands. Commands should be separated by a newline. They will be executed daily. Here is an example of a first turn:

```
labor mill
fight spider-lair
siege west
```

This is just an example; feel free to issue different commands based on your character's goals.

The description of your character and its state will be stored in an auto-generated comment after the first execution.
