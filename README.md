# Orcs Have Issues

A unique multiplayer RPG where the game world unfolds directly within GitHub Issues. Ideal for players who regularly engage with GitHub, this game requires just a few minutes of your time each day. The gameplay centers around the conflict between two factions: Orcs and Humans. Choose your side and engage in sieges that shape the fate of your faction.

## How to Play

- **Create a Character:** [Open a new issue](https://github.com/MikeAmputer/orcs-have-issues/issues/new/choose), select your race, and give your character a name.
- **Earn Perks:** Add a character description, get emoji reactions, and star the repo to boost your stats!
- **Choose Actions:** Post commands like `labor mill`, `fight spider-lair`, or `siege west` as comments on your character's issue. Actions are processed daily at 00:00 UTC.
- **Track Progress:** View your character's updated stats and logs after actions are executed.
- **Earn Achievements:** Check out the [`orcs-earn-badges`](https://github.com/MikeAmputer/orcs-earn-badges) repository to track your achievements and add badges to your GitHub profile README _(more badges coming soon)_.
